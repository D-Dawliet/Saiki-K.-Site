<p style="margin: 0px; color: lightseagreen; font-size: 20px;">Kusuo Saiki (斉木 楠雄, さいき くすお lit. Saiki Kusuo) is the main protagonist of Saiki Kusuo no Ψ Nan who has all kinds of
psychic related abilities. He usually tries to avoid getting involved in problematic or attention-grabbing situations,
but his attempts always end up going wrong or having unusual ends to his displeasure. His trademark appearance contains
his constant frown, his green-tinted glasses and two pink antennas located slightly above each ear, which have the
function of limiting his power. Initially he was always seen alone, but in the course of the story he develops lasting
friendships with his classmates and schoolmates, especially with Riki Nendou and Shun Kaido, or with his neighbors like
Yuuta Iridatsu. Kusuo was starred by Kento Yamazaki in the live action movie based on the series. <br><br><b>Appearance:</b> Kusuo has an average build and height. He has short pink hair, fair skin, and purple eyes. Kusuo wears a pair of controller devices, one on each side of his head, which are never removed except in situations of absolute necessity or by accident. The devices resemble white, cyan antennae, with pink, lollipop-like spheres. Accompanying the devices, Kusuo wears white glasses with lime green lenses to prevent his petrification power. During the days he has school, he wears the standard PK Academy uniform that all male students wear. On his days off from school, he occasionally wears
clothes that are sewn by his mother. However, there are times he is forced to buy clothes since his mother has an exotic taste in clothing patterns. <br><br> <b>Personality & traits:</b> When Kusuo was a child, he was more open to his emotions. Part of it was due to the fact that he was unaware of what his powers did, such as breaking a whack-a-mole machine in an arcade and thinking the machine was giving him praise. He was highly mischievous, such as making his parents look for him for 5 hours after he teleported, and smiled around
others without a second thought. However over the course of time, with having to hide his psychic powers from others and
his abilities slowly ruining experiences for him, he started to close himself up....<a style="color: rgb(20, 131, 103); text-decoration: none;"
